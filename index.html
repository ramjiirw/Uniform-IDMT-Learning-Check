const quizData = [

{
question:"What is the primary purpose of IDMT?",
options:[
"To automatically remove or cleanse data using defined rules",
"To insert new case records",
"To schedule background services",
"To send automated notifications"
],
correct:0,
explanation:"IDMT is designed to remove or cleanse existing data in a controlled and auditable way. It does not insert operational data into live cases. When a rule runs, it removes selected data and can either leave the field blank, apply the default text Data Removed, or use a defined replacement value. This ensures transparency while maintaining governance over system changes."
},

{
question:"A Test run returns 2,450 records. What should be done before running the rule live?",
options:[
"Run it immediately",
"Delete the rule",
"Disable audit",
"Review whether the volume and criteria are correct"
],
correct:3,
explanation:"A large result set should always prompt review. Before running the rule live, confirm that the selection criteria are correct and that the volume of records is expected. Running without validation may result in widespread unintended data removal."
},

{
question:"What must a rule contain before it can run?",
options:[
"An audit export",
"Selection criteria and at least one action",
"A DMS link",
"A scheduled service"
],
correct:1,
explanation:"A rule requires selection criteria to identify which records are targeted and at least one action to define what change will occur. Without both components, the rule has nothing to process. The logic must clearly define both what to find and what to change."
},

{
question:"An administrator creates a rule with very broad selection criteria and runs it live without testing. What is the most likely outcome?",
options:[
"The rule will automatically fail",
"The audit will be disabled",
"More records than intended may be affected",
"The system blocks the update"
],
correct:2,
explanation:"Broad selection criteria increase the number of matched records. If a rule is run live without testing, it may remove data from more records than intended. This can have operational consequences and require remediation, which is why testing is essential."
},

{
question:"When removing data using IDMT, what replacement options are available?",
options:[
"Insert a new case reference only",
"Automatically archive the field",
"Replace with a system generated audit ID",
"Leave blank, use default Data Removed, or define your own replacement text"
],
correct:3,
explanation:"When data is removed, the field can be left blank, populated with the default value Data Removed, or replaced with a defined value. This ensures users can see that data previously existed while maintaining data protection and governance controls."
},

{
question:"A Test run returns zero records, but several matches were expected. What should be reviewed first?",
options:[
"The selection criteria",
"The audit table",
"The server status",
"The HTML formatting"
],
correct:0,
explanation:"If a Test returns zero results, the most likely cause is that the selection criteria do not match any current records. Reviewing filters, date ranges and field values should be the first step before assuming a system issue."
},

{
question:"Why is the Audit feature important in IDMT?",
options:[
"It increases rule performance",
"It reduces database size",
"It records who made changes and what was changed",
"It blocks unauthorised users"
],
correct:2,
explanation:"The Audit feature provides traceability. It records which records were updated, when the change occurred, and which rule applied the update. This supports governance, accountability and the ability to investigate changes if required."
},

{
question:"An administrator creates a rule using KEYVAL to remove all related contact records for a specific case. What will be removed when the rule runs?",
options:[
"Only the email field within each contact",
"The entire contact records linked to that case",
"The case itself",
"The audit history"
],
correct:1,
explanation:"When KEYVAL is used to target related records in a child table such as Contacts, the rule removes the entire matching rows. This is a record level deletion rather than blanking a single field. Understanding table relationships is essential before running such rules."
},

{
question:"Why should rules be clearly named and documented?",
options:[
"To improve processing speed",
"To allow automatic scheduling",
"To reduce audit entries",
"To support governance and future review"
],
correct:3,
explanation:"Clear naming and documentation ensure that other administrators understand the purpose and scope of a rule. This supports governance, reduces risk, and makes future review or auditing significantly easier."
},

{
question:"A rule appears to remain in Running status longer than expected. What should be considered before escalating?",
options:[
"The dataset being processed may be large",
"The system has crashed",
"The audit has failed",
"The rule has deleted itself"
],
correct:0,
explanation:"Rules processing a large number of records may take longer to complete. Confirming the volume of matched records and understanding the dataset size is important before assuming there is a system fault."
},

{
question:"When is IDMT most appropriate to use?",
options:[
"For formatting HTML content",
"For one off personal changes",
"When removing or cleansing data across multiple records",
"For resetting user passwords"
],
correct:2,
explanation:"IDMT is most appropriate when removing or cleansing data consistently across multiple records. It provides structured control, ensures repeatability, and reduces the risk of manual error when applying changes at scale."
},

{
question:"An administrator removes data but chooses to leave the replacement field blank. What will be stored in that field?",
options:[
"Data Removed",
"Null or blank",
"The previous value",
"An audit reference number"
],
correct:1,
explanation:"If no replacement value is selected, the field will be left blank. However, the Audit trail will still record that the data was removed, ensuring the change remains traceable even if the field shows no visible value."
},

{
question:"What happens when a rule is run live after testing?",
options:[
"The system schedules it automatically",
"The audit is cleared",
"The rule disables itself",
"The selected records are permanently updated according to the defined action"
],
correct:3,
explanation:"When a rule is run live, the defined action is applied to all records that match the selection criteria. These updates are permanent and are recorded in the Audit trail. Testing beforehand ensures confidence before applying irreversible changes."
},

{
question:"Why is understanding table relationships important when designing an IDMT rule?",
options:[
"It improves system performance",
"It reduces screen loading time",
"It prevents user login issues",
"It ensures the correct records and related data are targeted"
],
correct:3,
explanation:"IDMT can target parent and child records. Understanding how tables relate to each other ensures that rules affect only the intended records and do not unintentionally remove related data. Structural awareness reduces risk during rule design."
